## Main Street
The main street of the town is completely empty. The only sign of movement is various papers floating in the wind. The buildings are all shades of tan and grey, and with very little windows giving them the appearance of cliffs. The signs on the shops are all faded and the storefronts are blocked off by metal barriers. Some buildings are in far worse states of disrepair, collapsed ceilings, the works. 
To the southwest is the bank, a large rectangular structure with ornate molded details that are completely alien to the other buildings in town.
To the east is a drug store, a skinny structure in between two massive apartment buildings, it’s sign has long since faded, but the faded orange on the sign is possibly the brightest color in the bleak landscape.
To the north is the exit to the town and a hotel, probably one of the shorter structures in the area ironically. 
## Bank
The bank’s floors are immaculately clean, to the point where you can see your reflection in the flooring. Through the teller windows to the north, you can see the vault door hanging wide open. 
The vault itself is completely empty as well, and the safe-deposit boxes are all open and empty, except for one, locked shut. Lockbox 173. 
	Opening the lockbox reveals a dust-covered note. 
	“Hey there Detective. It’s NAV again. You might be wondering why the town is abandoned. There’s a dangerous known as MZU who’s captured the citizens of this town and is using the city as a ground zeroes to test a chemical weapon capable of wiping out most of the life on the planet, Luckily, he wasn’t able to mass-produce the weapon before he captured the citizens, so I managed to secure the sample he was able to procure and stashed it into the hotel. Go up to room 501 and check inside the toilet lid for a small vial. You need to bring it to the pharmacy where you can dilute the sample using some of the antibiotics I stashed there, thus destroying the weapon entirely. Once you do that, I will contact you and we can go save the denizens of Blackburn, I would have called authorities but I was afraid he would unleash his virus sooner which is why I called you.”

keycard; with the numbers 501 etched into the card surface with fancy gold print reading “ Hotel Burns”.
## Hotel
	The lobby of the hotel was very boxy like the rest of the town. The ceiling was made up of a strange tile pattern that seemed to change directions and rotations randomly like it had been tiled by some sort of monkey with a pension for making your eyes water. There is an elevator to the northwest and the automatic doors leading back to Mainstreet to the south. The stairway seems to have collapsed, at least on the ground floor.
# Elevator
	Stepping into the elevator, most of the buttons seem to be missing, specifically button 5, but button four still remains.

# Floor 4
	When the elevator came to a stop and you stepped off you were greeted by a pitch-black hallway. The lights seem to be off so it’s nearly impossible to navigate.

# Floor 4 after using a flashlight
	Illuminating the beige walls you see a passage to the left and to the right out of the hallway. None of the room doors are unlocked, but one in particular, room 404, is welded shut, by a blow torch of some kind, the hinges are crudely welded and the doorknob is a melted mess.

# Going Left
	Leads to a dead end 

# Going Right
	You round the corner and approach a stairwell. The stairs downward seem to be beyond disrepair but the stairs up seem to be in perfect condition. Going up the stairs leads you to floor 5


# Floor 5
	This hallway seems to be lit up, and you quickly find Room 501. At the end of the hallway, you can see a left and right exit, 

# Floor 5 Left
	The elevator doors are wide open and you can see the elevator on floor four and the cables supporting the cart

# Floor 5 Right
	Just a window and a dried-up potted plant.

## Room 501
	After tapping the keycard onto the door’s electronic lock, there’s a mechanical click and the door swings open, revealing a singular queen-sized bed and a big window with brown silk curtains. To the south is the exit to the room and to the east is the bathroom. 

# Room 501 Bathroom.
	You step into the albeit small bathroom. The mirror feels way too small in proportion with the countertop and the sink is about the size of a small soup bowl for an appetizer at a cheap Italian restaurant famous for its endless breadsticks. The most unsettling part is the toilet. Instead of a regular porcelain white, it’s a weird dark gray color that almost looks industrial. The exit is to the west.

# Contents of the toilet lid
	Bobbing in the dusty water is a small vial of a green liquid, no bigger than an index finger.

## Pharmacy
	It’s a large and empty area that looks a bit like a grocery store, except the shelves are covered in blank white pill bottles that contain nothing. The backdoor seems to be locked by an electronic lock requiring a passcode. Attached to it is a note that says (#1 + #2) (The solution is to add 173 and 501 together).

# Pharmacy Backroom
	Punching in the code, the door opens and reveals a medicine storage area, most of the boxes just have those blank white pill bottles. There’s a machine in the corner of the room that seems to dispense various types of medication from an array of containers that all seem to be empty, except for one. A variety of pink pills fills one of the capsules and has a handwritten label reading vancomycin.

# Mixing the anti-biotics and the vial
	Dropping a few of the pills into the vial, the effect is instant as the liquid turns from green to clear instantly. There’s a whirring above you and you glance upwards to catch one of the manilla ceiling tiles flip up and a security camera lowers slowly. 
	A robotic voice speaks from the camera “You fool. Detective, that was the antidote for the virus. I just caught the world’s greatest detective annihilating the only evidence of my ultimate crime! The truth is this isn’t even a city. This is all a staging ground for my weapon, the NOT-A-VIRUS virus!” 
	A screen folded down next to the camera. Text flashed on with a count down. “15 MINUTES TILL DETONATION” 
	At this point, the player would have a limited amount of actions to escape the pharmacy.

## Emerging from the pharmacy
	As you sprint down Mainstreet, desperately trying to get away from the impending explosion, a rectangular craft emerges from behind the buildings. It has four massive engines emitting purple light. A massive gust of wind blasts you as it touches down in the middle of the street. It’s silvery front end opens up and you see four figures emerge and a ramp lower. 
	“DETECTIVE! Hop on! We’re getting you out of here!” one of the figures shouted. 
# The Shuttle
	You sprint onto the shuttle, the hatch shuts behind you and the craft lurches into the sky. The world shakes as a deafening explosion erupts from the town. From outside one of the portholes you see a massive gas cloud emerging from the crater that was the town.
	But all of a sudden everything froze, the shuttle, the town, everything. 
	A shadowy figure approaches you. “Welcome aboard Detective, the name’s MZU, You’ve been a rather unsuccessful test of our anti-virus we’re trying to sell, I think we’re going to try and run this one again, Hey let’s reset the simulation.”
THE END
