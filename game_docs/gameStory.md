## Main Street
The main street of the town is completely empty. The only sign of movement is various papers floating in the wind. The buildings are all shades of tan and grey, and with very little windows giving them the appearance of cliffs. The signs on the shops are all faded and the storefronts are blocked off by metal barriers. Some buildings are in far worse states of disrepair, collapsed ceilings, the works. 
To the southwest is the bank, a large rectangular structure with ornate molded details that are completely alien to the other buildings in town.
To the east is a drug store, a skinny structure in between two massive apartment buildings, it’s sign has long since faded, but the faded orange on the sign is possibly the brightest color in the bleak landscape.
To the north is the exit to the town and a hotel, probably one of the shorter structures in the area ironically. 
## Bank
The bank’s floors are immaculately clean, to the point where you can see your reflection in the flooring. Through the teller windows to the north, you can see the vault door hanging wide open. 
The vault itself is completely empty as well, and the safe-deposit boxes are all open and empty, except for one, locked shut. Lockbox 173. 
	Opening the lockbox reveals a dust-covered note. 
	“Hey there Detective. It’s NAV again. You might be wondering why the town is abandoned. There’s a dangerous known as MZU who’s captured the citizens of this town and is using the city as a ground zeroes to test a chemical weapon capable of wiping out most of the life on the planet, Luckily, he wasn’t able to mass-produce the weapon before he captured the citizens, so I managed to secure the sample he was able to procure and stashed it into the hotel. Go up to room 501 and check inside the toilet lid for a small vial. You need to bring it to the pharmacy where you can dilute the sample using some of the antibiotics I stashed there, thus destroying the weapon entirely. Once you do that, I will contact you and we can go save the denizens of Blackburn, I would have called authorities but I was afraid he would unleash his virus sooner which is why I called you.”
