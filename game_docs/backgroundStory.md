# Text Adventure Game (Working Title)

## Backstory
You are a world-class private eye famous for solving many cases. You recently retired after an accident involving a runaway train, fourteen boxes of dynamite, and a crazed lion-tamer. You’ve returned home after packing up the office and making some goodbyes to others in the agency.
	It’s a cold night so you’ve got the fireplace running and you’re reading the latest issue of “Detectives staring at the fireplace on cold winter nights editorial” when you hear a knock on your door. You lurch out of your chair and swing open the door only to find the cold night and an unmarked envelope on the doormat containing a letter. It read as follows:

	“Hello, detective. I need your help. Take this key to the bank in Blackburn and open lockbox #173. I’ve enclosed a plane ticket to the airport just an hour’s drive out of town.”
									-Signed NTV
	Inside is a plain white key with a stubby wooden handle and a first-class ticket departing tomorrow. With nothing better to do but be the stereotypical Christmas story narrator from a children’s movie, you decide to take up the quest and pack a suitcase before taking a taxi to the airport in the morning.

	After a three hour flight containing many crying children and a short cab ride you arrive in Blackburn and immediately something is amiss..
