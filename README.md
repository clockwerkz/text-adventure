# text-adventure


## Back Story
This project is a text based adventure that my oldest son and I are working on. The idea came about being currently quarantined for the covid-19 virus. It originally started as a simple text based adventure with my son writing up the text (with a fun, creative story line) and I building out the game engine. We first came up with just having canned options, and handling input from those choices. The project has evolved into a more complex system of parsing out the user's commands, and having the room change based on the user interaction.
